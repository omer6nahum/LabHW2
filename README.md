## Image Augmentations For a Fixed Model
Authors: Omer Madmon, Omer Nahum

In this task we are asked to improve the performance of a (static given) ResNet50 model in roman digits classification, by only modifying and enriching the dataset it is trained on. In particular, we have access to ~2000 images and we are asked to create our own training and validation sets, under the constraint that the two sets together have at most 10,000 images.

Our aim is to modify and enrich the training set in a way that should help the model learn meaningful patterns in the data. The methods we decided to apply on the training set were filtering and augmentations.
